# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains details such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, which are used to build a predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It consists of:

train.csv – Training data with survival labels.
test.csv – Testing data (without survival labels).
gender_submission.csv – Sample submission file.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-Learn – Machine learning models
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed missing values and handled them appropriately.
Visualized survival rates based on gender, class, and age.
Identified important features influencing survival.
Model Building
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values
Converted categorical data into numerical format
Scaled numerical features
Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model Evaluation

Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate models.
Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
How to Run the Project
Install required libraries using:
nginx
